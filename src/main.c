 * This file is part of the radexi-cmd program - C language implementation of 
 * RADEX software package. It is used to calculate molecular exitation and 
 * radiative transfer in a homogenuous medium. The purpose of this full 
 * refactoring is to speed up the process of calculation and implement some new
 * features like databases. It will make the program more stable and usable, 
 * which is crucial for newcomers.
